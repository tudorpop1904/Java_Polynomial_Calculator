# Java Polynomial Calculator
# Brief Description

This is a pure Java GUI desktop application which handles the calculation of distinct polynomial operations. The application supports distinct polynomial operations such as addition (binary), subtraction (binary), multiplication (binary), division (binary), differentiation (unary), and integration (unary). The syntax for an input polynomial respects the typical "a_n*x^n + a_n-1*x^n-1 + ... + a_1*x + a_0" polynomial format (spaces may or may not be added) between terms. Also, the + sign may be replaced with a - sign if needed.

# Required Software and Usage:

This project requires a Java IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA. Upon inserting the java files in the respective src/main/java folder, one may run the application and the Javax Swing GUI will appear on screen.
